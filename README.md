# tic-tac-toe

This is a simple vanilla JS tic-tac-toe project where players can enter names and play against each other.
The game looks out for draws, wins and three-wins-in-a-row. 

The development approach of console-first as encouraged in the project is remarkable. I definitely learned a lot from doing this project. One remarkable thing I learned is that closures in JS have far-reaching uses - more than I ever imagined.

While updating this README, I just that the Odin Project Node path had major updates and I can't wait to get back to studying. The skills I learn here, I hope to put into use in the nearest future.

Ill keep you updated on my progress.

On y va!
